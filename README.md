# Riegeli

*Riegeli/records* is a file format for storing a sequence of string records,
typically serialized protocol buffers. It supports dense compression, fast
decoding, seeking, detection and optional skipping of data corruption, filtering
of proto message fields for even faster decoding, and parallel encoding.

See [documentation](doc/index.md).

# Status

You are welcome to try Riegeli out. The file format is not frozen yet though.
